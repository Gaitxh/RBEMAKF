**Demo 1**: Comparison of dynamic estimation results between the proposed RBEMAKF and other advanced methods in the presence of inaccurate and time-varying PMNCMs.

**Demo 2** and **Demo 3**: Comparison of dynamic estimation results between the proposed L-RBEMAKF and ST-RBEMAKF and other advanced methods in the presence of inaccurate and time-varying PMNCMs with outliers. These two files discuss the impact of outlier frequency and outlier intensity separately.
